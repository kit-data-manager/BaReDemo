Introduction
------------
This section gives a short introduction about the Basic Repository Demonstrator (BaReDemo). `BaReDemo` serves as showcase for highly customized repository solutions. 
It allows to manage digital object including Dublin Core metadata. An easy-to-use Web interface allows to manage and to retrieve digital objects in a Google-like 
simplicity. By default, all digital objects stored in `BaReDemo` are open access, meaning everybody can retrieve all digital objects. For further interaction, e.g.
modifying metadata, objects can be shared with other registered users by the owner who initially ingested the object. Details on how to use the respository can be found in 
chapter <<ChapterUsage,Usage>>.

Installation
------------
`BaReDemo` consists of a couple of Docker containers. The <<FigureDocker,figure below>> shows how the three involved containers are linked to each other.

[NOTE]
In order to talk to each other the containers are using socket-based communication. Each container provides different ports that must not be in use. Relevant ports are: 
5432 (postgresql), 9200/9300 (elasticsearch), 8080/8889 (tomcat). Please stop any service running on one of these ports before you start the Docker containers.

Using Docker allows shipping the entire demonstrator including all services, preconfigured and ready to use, with a small footprint of less than 100 MB. Also the number of prerequisites is rather 
small and namely Docker and an internet connection. Docker is available for all major Linux distributions, but in principal it should also be possible to setup `BaReDemo` using Docker for Windows or MacOS. 

However, in any case the first step is to install Docker, preferably using the local package manager. In the following Apt of Ubuntu is used: 

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------
user@localhost:/home/user$ sudo apt-get install docker
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
docker.io is already the newest version.
user@localhost:/home/user$
--------------------------------------

Furthermore, it is recommended to build and run the Docker containers as non-root user. In order to be able to use the Docker daemon as non-root user the user must be member of the group 'docker'.
To add the user to this group call:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------
user@localhost:/home/user$ sudo usermod -aG docker user
user@localhost:/home/user$
--------------------------------------

In order to be sure that all changes are applied properly it is recommended to reboot the system.

Now, please download and extract the current version of `BaReDemo` to any location, which will be referred below as `$REPO_LOCATION`. In a second step, make all 
contained scripts executable.

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------
user@localhost:/home/user$ cd $REPO_LOCATION
user@localhost:/home/user$ unzip BaReDemo-<Version>.zip
user@localhost:/home/user$ chmod 755 *.sh
user@localhost:/home/user$
--------------------------------------

Afterwards, $REPO_LOCATION has the following content:

By default, `BaReDemo` is accessible from localhost. For accessing it remotely '$REPO_LOCATION/postgres/sampledata.sql' and 
'$REPO_LOCATION/tomcat/conf/datamanager.xml' have to be adapted by replacing all occurences of 'localhost' by the hostname or the external IP of the 
machine running `BaReDemo`. In 'sampledata.sql' there is one occurence in line 47 (http://localhost:8889/webdav/), in 'datamanager.xml' there 
is also only one relevant occurence in line 9 (http://localhost:8889/BaReDemo).

[NOTE]
For older Ubuntu distributions the `docker` tool shipped with the distribution is not the one currently needed. The correct Docker tool is available in these Ubuntu software repositories 
with the name `docker.io`. As also the Docker executable changes, all five provided scripts have to be changed manually replacing calls to `docker` by `docker.io` 
before `BaReDemo` can be used.

Now `BaReDemo` can be built. Therefor, please use the provided script `build.sh` from within $REPO_LOCATION:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------
user@localhost:/home/user$ cd $REPO_LOCATION
user@localhost:/home/user$ ./build.sh
Sending build context to Docker daemon  72.7 kB
Sending build context to Docker daemon 
Step 0 : FROM ubuntu
 ---> c3d5614fecc4
Step 1 : MAINTAINER support@kitdatamanager.net
[...]
user@localhost:/home/user$
--------------------------------------

The build process sets up all three images, deploys the `BaReDemo` Web application into the Tomcat image and submits the database schema and basic database content to the 
PostgreSQL image. As soon as the build process has finished, all images are available locally and can be used to start the Docker containers for the first time. 
This has to be done from inside $REPO_LOCATION as the current working directory is obtained and used by the `initialize.sh` script. For starting `BaReDemo` please call:  

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------
user@localhost:/home/user$ cd $REPO_LOCATION
user@localhost:/home/user$ ./initialize.sh
32c6502bb54532b2769ef88ac2c3ff92e89e0627d26c8a905d7f119541180d2f
c265156e24dd597f5c24def2530149ebae73d95305ad66575916cf92d2d46492
332d2e5a782d7917bc8cc33ab06e11d728af5760054eeec1758978ec882b4ea8
user@localhost:/home/user$
--------------------------------------

The hashes represent the container ids and are different for each call of 'initialize.sh'. 
Now, `BaReDemo` will start which may take a while. The current status can be checked inside $REPO_LOCATION/share/log/catalina.out after a few seconds 
and as soon as the message `INFO: Server startup in 12345 ms` appears, `BaReDemo` is accessible via `http://localhost:8889/BaReDemo`.

Just for completeness, before starting to work with `BaReDemo`. Stopping the containers can be achieved using the `stop.sh` script: 

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------
user@localhost:/home/user$ cd $REPO_LOCATION
user@localhost:/home/user$ ./stop.sh
tomcat
elasticsearch
database
user@localhost:/home/user$
--------------------------------------

Now, all containers are stoppend and `BaReDemo` is not accessible any longer. However, no data (e.g. registered digital objects) has been removed.
Also the images are still available and the containers can be started again using the `start.sh` script:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------
user@localhost:/home/user$ cd $REPO_LOCATION
user@localhost:/home/user$ ./start.sh
database
elasticsearch
tomcat
user@localhost:/home/user$
--------------------------------------

For removing the images and all data from the local system please use the `rm.sh` script after calling `stop.sh`:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------
user@localhost:/home/user$ cd $REPO_LOCATION
user@localhost:/home/user$ ./rm.sh
tomcat
elasticsearch
database
user@localhost:/home/user$
--------------------------------------

After this call, all data created by `BaReDemo` is removed. Only the data written to the outside of the containers (everything stored in $REPO_LOCATION/share) will
still exist. In order to start a new instance of `BaReDemo`, `initialize.sh` has to be called again.

[NOTE]
The only valid execution workflow for the scripts is build.sh (typically only once) > initialize.sh > stop.sh > start.sh or rm.sh > intialize.sh > ... 
Calling them in a different order will result in an error message. In case of an error you can reset everything by calling `stop.sh` followed by `rm.sh` 
ignoring all error messages that may arise. Afterwards, all containers and images are removed and `BaReDemo` can be started again using 
`initialize.sh`.
